The [UCL Deciding, Acting, and Reasoning with Knowledge (**DARK**) Lab](https://dark.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) is a Reinforcement Learning research group at the [UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/). We focus on research in [complex open-ended environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13760) that provide a constant stream of novel observations without reliable reward functions, often requiring agents to [create their own curricula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03934) and to deal with [external knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08210), [natural language](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03926), and [hard exploration problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12292).
